# Teotl Theorema source code

![Teotl Theorema](https://github.com/JesseKon/Teotl-Theorem-source-code/blob/main/coverimg.png)

This repository holds the source code files for an exploration game called Teotl Theorema (0.2beta), made in Unity. Only the source code is included, not other assets. The code does not follow the best Unity C# scripting practices, so beware. :D

The full game (in binary format) can be downloaded from here: https://jessekon.itch.io/teotl-theorema
