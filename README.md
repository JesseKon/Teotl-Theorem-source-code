# Teotl Theorema source code

[img]

This repository holds the source code files for an exploration game called Teotl Theorema (0.2beta). Only the source code is included, not other assets. The code does not follow the best Unity C# scripting practices, so beware. :D

The full game (in binary format) can be downloaded from here: https://jessekon.itch.io/teotl-theorema
